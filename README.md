Pre-training and Transfer learning papers for recommendation 

Several of our research papers that apply pre-training, transfer learning and representation learning for cross-domain recommendation and user profile prediction:

1 Parameter-Efficient Transfer from Sequential Behaviors for User Modeling and Recommendation SIGIR2020

2 One Person, One Model, One World: Learning Continual User Representation without Forgetting SIGIR2021

3 Learning Transferable User Representations with Sequential Behaviors via Contrastive Pre-training ICDM2021

4 User-specific Adaptive Fine-tuning for Cross-domain Recommendations TKDE2021

We have also released large-scale dataset (over 1 million user clicking behaviors) for performing transfer learning of user preference in recommendation field
