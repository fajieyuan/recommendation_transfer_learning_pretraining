Pre-training and Transfer learning papers for recommendation 

Several of our research papers that apply pre-training, transfer learning and representation learning for cross-domain recommendation and user profile prediction:

1 Parameter-Efficient Transfer from Sequential Behaviors for User Modeling and Recommendation SIGIR2020 https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04253

Keywords: self-supervise learning, user sequential behaviors, pretraining, transfer learning, user representation, user profile prediction, cold-start problem

2 One Person, One Model, One World: Learning Continual User Representation without Forgetting SIGIR2021 https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13724

Keywords: self-supervise learning, lifelong learning, pretraining, transfer learning, finetuning, user representation, user profile prediction, cold-start problem

3 Learning Transferable User Representations with Sequential Behaviors via Contrastive Pre-training ICDM2021 https://fajieyuan.github.io/papers/ICDM2021.pdf

Keywords: contrative learnng, self-supervise learning, transfer learning,  pretraining, finetuning, user representation, user profile prediction, cold-start problem

4 User-specific Adaptive Fine-tuning for Cross-domain Recommendations TKDE2021 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10989.pdf

Keywords: adaptive finetuning, pretraining, cold-start problem, cross-domain recommendation

We have also released large-scale dataset (over 1 million user clicking behaviors) for performing transfer learning of user preference in recommendation field
